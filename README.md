## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

The official backend includes several production-ready optimizations for maximum inference speed:

| Optimization | Impact | Hardware Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **Flash Attention 2** | +10% faster | Ampere+ GPU (RTX 30xx/40xx) | ✅ Enabled |
| **torch.compile()** | +20-30% faster | Any CUDA GPU | ✅ Enabled |
| **TF32 Precision** | +3-5x matmul speed | Ampere+ GPU | ✅ Enabled |
| **cuDNN Benchmark** | +5-10% faster | Any CUDA GPU | ✅ Enabled |
| **BFloat16** | -50% VRAM | Turing+ GPU (RTX 20xx+) | ✅ Enabled |

**Combined Effect:** ~25-35% speedup over baseline (expected RTF: 0.65-0.70)

⚠️ **Note**: torch.compile() and cuDNN benchmarking require warmup. First 2-3 requests may be slower (~10-30s) while optimizations initialize.

📖 **See [OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md](OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md)** for detailed information about each optimization, how to enable/disable them, and troubleshooting tips.

## 🚀 Quick Start (API Server)

### Using OpenAI Python Client

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Point to your local Qwen3-TTS server
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8881/v1",
    api_key="not-needed"  # API key not required for local server
)

# Generate speech
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="qwen3-tts",
    voice="Vivian",  # Or: Ryan, Serena, Dylan, Eric, Aiden, etc.
    input="Hello! This is Qwen3-TTS speaking with an OpenAI-compatible API.",
    response_format="mp3",  # Options: mp3, opus, aac, flac, wav, pcm
    speed=1.0  # 0.25 to 4.0
)

response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
```

### Language-Specific Models

You can force a specific language by using language-suffixed model names. This overrides any language parameter passed from the client (useful for integration with open-webui):

```python
# Force Spanish output regardless of language parameter
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1-es",  # Spanish
    voice="Vivian",
    input="Hola! Este es Qwen3-TTS."
)

# Force French output
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1-hd-fr",  # French (HD quality)
    voice="Vivian",
    input="Bonjour! Ceci est Qwen3-TTS."
)
```

**Supported Language Codes:**
- `tts-1-en` or `tts-1-hd-en` - English
- `tts-1-zh` or `tts-1-hd-zh` - Chinese
- `tts-1-ja` or `tts-1-hd-ja` - Japanese
- `tts-1-ko` or `tts-1-hd-ko` - Korean
- `tts-1-de` or `tts-1-hd-de` - German
- `tts-1-fr` or `tts-1-hd-fr` - French
- `tts-1-es` or `tts-1-hd-es` - Spanish
- `tts-1-ru` or `tts-1-hd-ru` - Russian
- `tts-1-pt` or `tts-1-hd-pt` - Portuguese
- `tts-1-it` or `tts-1-hd-it` - Italian

When using these language-specific models, any `language` parameter in the request will be ignored, ensuring consistent output in the specified language.

### Web Interface

After starting the server, visit `http://localhost:8881` for an interactive web demo:

## Overview
### Introduction

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-TTS-Repo/qwen3_tts_introduction.png" width="90%"/>
<p>

Qwen3-TTS covers 10 major languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian) as well as multiple dialectal voice profiles to meet global application needs. In addition, the models feature strong contextual understanding, enabling adaptive control of tone, speaking rate, and emotional expression based on instructions and text semantics, and they show markedly improved robustness to noisy input text. Key features:

* **Powerful Speech Representation**: Powered by the self-developed Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz, it achieves efficient acoustic compression and high-dimensional semantic modeling of speech signals. It fully preserves paralinguistic information and acoustic environmental features, enabling high-speed, high-fidelity speech reconstruction through a lightweight non-DiT architecture.
* **Universal End-to-End Architecture**: Utilizing a discrete multi-codebook LM architecture, it realizes full-information end-to-end speech modeling. This completely bypasses the information bottlenecks and cascading errors inherent in traditional LM+DiT schemes, significantly enhancing the model’s versatility, generation efficiency, and performance ceiling.
* **Extreme Low-Latency Streaming Generation**: Based on the innovative Dual-Track hybrid streaming generation architecture, a single model supports both streaming and non-streaming generation. It can output the first audio packet immediately after a single character is input, with end-to-end synthesis latency as low as 97ms, meeting the rigorous demands of real-time interactive scenarios.
* **Intelligent Text Understanding and Voice Control**: Supports speech generation driven by natural language instructions, allowing for flexible control over multi-dimensional acoustic attributes such as timbre, emotion, and prosody. By deeply integrating text semantic understanding, the model adaptively adjusts tone, rhythm, and emotional expression, achieving lifelike “what you imagine is what you hear” output.

```


## Quickstart (Python Package)

### Environment Setup

The easiest way to quickly use Qwen3-TTS is to install the `qwen-tts` Python package from PyPI. This will pull in the required runtime dependencies and allow you to load any released Qwen3-TTS model. We recommend using a **fresh, isolated environment** to avoid dependency conflicts with existing packages. You can create a clean Python 3.12 environment like this:

```bash
conda create -n qwen3-tts python=3.12 -y
conda activate qwen3-tts
```

then run:

```bash
pip install -U qwen-tts
```

If you want to develop or modify the code locally, install from source in editable mode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS.git
cd Qwen3-TTS
pip install -e .
```

Additionally, we recommend using FlashAttention 2 to reduce GPU memory usage.

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

If your machine has less than 96GB of RAM and lots of CPU cores, run:

```bash
MAX_JOBS=4 pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Also, you should have hardware that is compatible with FlashAttention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the [FlashAttention repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention 2 can only be used when a model is loaded in `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`.


### Python Package Usage

After installation, you can import `Qwen3TTSModel` to run custom voice TTS, voice design, and voice clone. The model weights can be specified either as a Hugging Face model id (recommended) or as a local directory path you downloaded. For all the `generate_*` functions below, besides the parameters shown and explicitly documented, you can also pass generation kwargs supported by Hugging Face Transformers `model.generate`, e.g., `max_new_tokens`, `top_p`, etc.

#### Custom Voice Generate

For custom voice models (`Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B/0.6B-CustomVoice`), you just need to call `generate_custom_voice`, passing a single string or a batch list, along with `language`, `speaker`, and optional `instruct`. You can also call `model.get_supported_speakers()` and `model.get_supported_languages()` to see which speakers and languages the current model supports.

```python
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

# single inference
wavs, sr = model.generate_custom_voice(
    text="其实我真的有发现，我是一个特别善于观察别人情绪的人。",
    language="Chinese", # Pass `Auto` (or omit) for auto language adaptive; if the target language is known, set it explicitly.
    speaker="Vivian",
    instruct="用特别愤怒的语气说", # Omit if not needed.
)
sf.write("output_custom_voice.wav", wavs[0], sr)

# batch inference
wavs, sr = model.generate_custom_voice(
    text=[
        "其实我真的有发现，我是一个特别善于观察别人情绪的人。", 
        "She said she would be here by noon."
    ],
    language=["Chinese", "English"],
    speaker=["Vivian", "Ryan"],
    instruct=["", "Very happy."]
)
sf.write("output_custom_voice_1.wav", wavs[0], sr)
sf.write("output_custom_voice_2.wav", wavs[1], sr)
```

For `Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B/0.6B-CustomVoice` models, the supported speaker list and speaker descriptions are provided below. We recommend using each speaker’s native language for the best quality. Of course, each speaker can speak any language supported by the model.

| Speaker | Voice Description  |  Native language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vivian | Bright, slightly edgy young female voice. | Chinese |
| Serena | Warm, gentle young female voice. | Chinese |
| Uncle_Fu | Seasoned male voice with a low, mellow timbre. | Chinese |
| Dylan | Youthful Beijing male voice with a clear, natural timbre. | Chinese (Beijing Dialect) |
| Eric | Lively Chengdu male voice with a slightly husky brightness. | Chinese (Sichuan Dialect) |
| Ryan | Dynamic male voice with strong rhythmic drive. | English |
| Aiden | Sunny American male voice with a clear midrange. | English |
| Ono_Anna | Playful Japanese female voice with a light, nimble timbre. | Japanese |
| Sohee | Warm Korean female voice with rich emotion. | Korean |

#### Voice Design

For the voice design model (`Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign`), you can use `generate_voice_design` to provide the target text and a natural-language `instruct` description.

```python
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

# single inference
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_design(
    text="哥哥，你回来啦，人家等了你好久好久了，要抱抱！",
    language="Chinese",
    instruct="体现撒娇稚嫩的萝莉女声，音调偏高且起伏明显，营造出黏人、做作又刻意卖萌的听觉效果。",
)
sf.write("output_voice_design.wav", wavs[0], sr)

# batch inference
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_design(
    text=[
      "哥哥，你回来啦，人家等了你好久好久了，要抱抱！",
      "It's in the top drawer... wait, it's empty? No way, that's impossible! I'm sure I put it there!"
    ],

#### Voice Clone

For the voice clone model (`Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B/0.6B-Base`), to clone a voice and synthesize new content, you just need to provide a reference audio clip (`ref_audio`) along with its transcript (`ref_text`). `ref_audio` can be a local file path, a URL, a base64 string, or a `(numpy_array, sample_rate)` tuple. If you set `x_vector_only_mode=True`, only the speaker embedding is used so `ref_text` is not required, but cloning quality may be reduced.

```python
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

ref_audio = "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-TTS-Repo/clone.wav"
ref_text  = "Okay. Yeah. I resent you. I love you. I respect you. But you know what? You blew it! And thanks to you."

wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text="I am solving the equation: x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a? Nobody can — it's a disaster (◍•͈⌔•͈◍), very sad!",
    language="English",
    ref_audio=ref_audio,
    ref_text=ref_text,
)
sf.write("output_voice_clone.wav", wavs[0], sr)
```

If you need to reuse the same reference prompt across multiple generations (to avoid recomputing prompt features), build it once with `create_voice_clone_prompt` and pass it via `voice_clone_prompt`.

```python
prompt_items = model.create_voice_clone_prompt(
    ref_audio=ref_audio,
    ref_text=ref_text,
    x_vector_only_mode=False,
)
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text=["Sentence A.", "Sentence B."],
    language=["English", "English"],
    voice_clone_prompt=prompt_items,
)
sf.write("output_voice_clone_1.wav", wavs[0], sr)
sf.write("output_voice_clone_2.wav", wavs[1], sr)
```

For more examples of reusable voice clone prompts, batch cloning, and batch inference, please refer to the [example codes](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/examples/test_model_12hz_base.py). With those examples and the `generate_voice_clone` function description, you can explore more advanced usage patterns.

#### Voice Design then Clone

If you want a designed voice that you can reuse like a cloned speaker, a practical workflow is: (1) use the **VoiceDesign** model to synthesize a short reference clip that matches your target persona, (2) feed that clip into `create_voice_clone_prompt` to build a reusable prompt, and then (3) call `generate_voice_clone` with `voice_clone_prompt` to generate new content without re-extracting features every time. This is especially useful when you want a consistent character voice across many lines.

```python
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

# create a reference audio in the target style using the VoiceDesign model
design_model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

ref_text = "H-hey! You dropped your... uh... calculus notebook? I mean, I think it's yours? Maybe?"
ref_instruct = "Male, 17 years old, tenor range, gaining confidence - deeper breath support now, though vowels still tighten when nervous"
ref_wavs, sr = design_model.generate_voice_design(
    text=ref_text,
    language="English",
    instruct=ref_instruct
)
sf.write("voice_design_reference.wav", ref_wavs[0], sr)

# build a reusable clone prompt from the voice design reference
clone_model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

voice_clone_prompt = clone_model.create_voice_clone_prompt(
    ref_audio=(ref_wavs[0], sr),   # or "voice_design_reference.wav"
    ref_text=ref_text,
)

sentences = [
    "No problem! I actually... kinda finished those already? If you want to compare answers or something...",
    "What? No! I mean yes but not like... I just think you're... your titration technique is really precise!",
]

# reuse it for multiple single calls
wavs, sr = clone_model.generate_voice_clone(
    text=sentences[0],
    language="English",
    voice_clone_prompt=voice_clone_prompt,
)
sf.write("clone_single_1.wav", wavs[0], sr)

wavs, sr = clone_model.generate_voice_clone(
    text=sentences[1],
    language="English",
    voice_clone_prompt=voice_clone_prompt,
)
sf.write("clone_single_2.wav", wavs[0], sr)

# or batch generate in one call
wavs, sr = clone_model.generate_voice_clone(
    text=sentences,
    language=["English", "English"],
    voice_clone_prompt=voice_clone_prompt,
)
for i, w in enumerate(wavs):
    sf.write(f"clone_batch_{i}.wav", w, sr)
```

#### Tokenizer Encode and Decode

If you only want to encode and decode audio for transport or training and so on, `Qwen3TTSTokenizer` supports encode/decode with paths, URLs, numpy waveforms, and dict/list payloads, for example:

```python
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSTokenizer

tokenizer = Qwen3TTSTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz",
    device_map="cuda:0",
)

enc = tokenizer.encode("https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-TTS-Repo/tokenizer_demo_1.wav")
wavs, sr = tokenizer.decode(enc)
sf.write("decode_output.wav", wavs[0], sr)
```

For more tokenizer examples (including different input formats and batch usage), please refer to the [example codes](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/examples/test_tokenizer_12hz.py). With those examples and the description for `Qwen3TTSTokenizer`, you can explore more advanced usage patterns.

### Launch Local Web UI Demo

To launch the Qwen3-TTS web ui demo, simply install the `qwen-tts` package and run `qwen-tts-demo`. Use the command below for help:

```bash
qwen-tts-demo --help
```

To launch the demo, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# CustomVoice model
qwen-tts-demo Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# VoiceDesign model
qwen-tts-demo Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# Base model
qwen-tts-demo Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

And then open `http://<your-ip>:8000`, or access it via port forwarding in tools like VS Code.

#### Base Model HTTPS Notes

To avoid browser microphone permission issues after deploying the server, for Base model deployments, it is recommended/required to run the gradio service over **HTTPS** (especially when accessed remotely or behind modern browsers/gateways). Use `--ssl-certfile` and `--ssl-keyfile` to enable HTTPS. First we need to generate a private key and a self-signed cert (valid for 365 days):

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

Then run the demo with HTTPS:

```bash
qwen-tts-demo Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base \
  --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \
  --ssl-certfile cert.pem \
  --ssl-keyfile key.pem \
  --no-ssl-verify
```

And open `https://<your-ip>:8000` to experience it. If your browser shows a warning, it’s expected for self-signed certificates. For production, use a real certificate.

python end2end.py --query-type Base --mode-tag icl
```

## Fine Tuning

Please refer to [Qwen3-TTS-Finetuning](finetuning/) for detailed instructions on fine-tuning Qwen3-TTS.

## Evaluation

During evaluation, we ran inference for all models with `dtype=torch.bfloat16` and set `max_new_tokens=2048`. All other sampling parameters used the defaults from the checkpoint’s `generate_config.json`. For the Seed-Test and InstructTTS-Eval test sets, we set `language="auto"`, while for all other test sets we explicitly passed the corresponding `language`. The detailed results are shown below.
