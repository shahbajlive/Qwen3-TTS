# Qwen3-TTS Docker Deployment Status

## ✅ Deployment Successful

The Qwen3-TTS OpenAI-Compatible API has been successfully deployed in Docker.

### Configuration
- **Container Name**: `qwen3-tts-api`
- **Port**: 8881
- **GPU**: GPU 2 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090)
- **GPU Memory Usage**: ~4.7 GB
- **Model**: Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base
- **Status**: Running and healthy

### Access Points
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:8881
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8881/docs
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8881/
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8881/health

### Available Models
- `qwen3-tts`
- `tts-1`
- `tts-1-hd`

### Test Results
All tests passed successfully:
- ✓ Health check: Working
- ✓ Model listing: Working
- ✓ Speech generation: Working (English)
- ✓ GPU usage: GPU 2 active with ~4.7GB memory

### Sample Usage

#### cURL Example
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8881/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "Hello! This is Qwen3 TTS.",
    "voice": "alloy",
    "response_format": "mp3"
  }' \
  --output output.mp3
```

#### Python Example
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8881/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "tts-1",
        "input": "Hello! This is Qwen3 TTS.",
        "voice": "alloy",
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }
)

with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

### Docker Commands

#### Start the container
```bash
docker-compose up -d qwen3-tts-gpu
```

#### Stop the container
```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### View logs
```bash
docker logs qwen3-tts-api -f
```

#### Restart the container
```bash
docker-compose restart qwen3-tts-gpu
```

### GPU Configuration
The deployment is configured to use GPU 2 specifically to avoid conflicts with other processes running on GPUs 0 and 1.

### Performance Notes
- Initial model loading takes ~50 seconds
- Speech generation is fast and efficient on GPU
- The container includes a health check that runs every 30 seconds

### Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yml`: Updated to use GPU 2 specifically
- `Dockerfile`: Added NUMBA_CACHE_DIR environment variable to fix librosa caching issues
